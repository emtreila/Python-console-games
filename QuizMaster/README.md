# ðŸ§  QuizMaster 

QuizMaster is a console-based application that lets you create, save, and solve multiple-choice quizzes. Each question includes 3 choices, one correct answer, and a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). You can generate custom quizzes based on difficulty and number of questions, and the program will calculate the score once the quiz is completed.

Where:
- `id`: unique numeric ID
- `difficulty`: one of `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`  

 Example: add 5;Which of the following numbers is prime?;5;56;75;5;easy

### 2.  Create Quiz
Generate a quiz from the master list:  
create <difficulty> <number_of_questions> <file>  
Where:
- `difficulty` = easy, medium, or hard  
- `number_of_questions` = how many questions to include  
- `file` = name of the file to save the quiz
