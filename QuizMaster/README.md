# 🧠 QuizMaster 

QuizMaster is a console-based application that lets you create, save, and solve multiple-choice quizzes. Each question includes 3 choices, one correct answer, and a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard). You can generate custom quizzes based on difficulty and number of questions, and the program will calculate the score once the quiz is completed.

## 📌 Features

Where:
- `id`: unique numeric ID
- `difficulty`: one of `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`  

📌 Example: add 5;Which of the following numbers is prime?;5;56;75;5;easy

### 2. 🛠️ Create Quiz
Generate a quiz from the master list:

- `file` = name of the file to save the quiz  

📌 Example: create easy 10 quiz1.txt
